# Aziro Cluster Center - UI Automation Dependencies

# CRITICAL: Install greenlet 3.2.4 FIRST (Python 3.14 compatibility)
# Playwright 1.48.0 requires greenlet==3.1.1 which doesn't support Python 3.14
# Solution: Use newer Playwright version that supports greenlet 3.2.4+
greenlet==3.2.4

# Playwright for browser automation
# Using newer version that's compatible with greenlet 3.2.4 and Python 3.14
playwright>=1.49.0
pytest-playwright>=0.5.2

# Testing framework
pytest==8.3.3
pytest-html==4.1.1
# pytest-xdist removed to avoid greenlet dependency (Python 3.14 compatibility)
# Note: Parallel execution not currently used - can be added back later if needed

# Utilities
python-dotenv==1.0.1
requests==2.32.3

# Dashboard
beautifulsoup4==4.12.3

# Note: allure-pytest removed to avoid greenlet dependency (Python 3.14 compatibility)
# The dashboard will work without Allure results - it gracefully handles missing data
